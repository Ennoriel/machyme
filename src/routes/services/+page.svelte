<p>
	I help both companies and startups focus on their area of expertise by building a fast
	user-oriented website that can leverage their product or service. I also extend or review existing
	websites to improve user experience or performance and save time and stress on the long run.
</p>
<blockquote>
	I follow the best practices of the time, not just about naming conventions and clear patterns but
	also accessibility, Internationalization, SEO, etc.
</blockquote>
<p>
	I am passionate about performance and code quality at scale! I have a strong experience in
	building maintainable web applications using component frameworks, TypeScript and other
	web-platform features around progressive enhancements.
	<a href="/projects">See my past experiences</a>.
</p>
<p>
	I love making shared maintainable, tested and documented code. I write guides, docs, and
	frameworks so the wheels keep turning when you're not online. Please let me the opportunity to
	make your product or service a success!
</p>

<h2>You are a startup?</h2>
<p>
	I can help you make the prototype of a mockup in to time while still making the good choices for
	your future architecture because you don't want to start over at each iteration.
</p>
<p>
	You'll be able to figure out your growth hypothesis and make your product or service a success.
</p>

<h2>You are a company?</h2>
<p>
	I can help build or extend your project (SEO, design system, reusable components, etc.). I will
	get straight to the point to fulfill your objectives while suggesting improvements where there is
	room for.
</p>
<p>
	I'll review your project structure or team organization and give you advice based on working past
	experiences.
